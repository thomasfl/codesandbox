                As a parent, you have an obligation to provide for your children
                as long as they are minors, even when they do not live with you.
                If your financial situation permits it, you may, as a parent,
                also be ordered to provide for children older than 18, provided
                they are still enrolled in an ordinary education programme.

                Children older than 18 have the right to have their situation

                Parents who are cohabitants with joint children have an
                obligation to provide for their children within the framework of
                their financial situation. This means that you will normally not
                qualify for financial assistance in providing for your joint
                child or children if one of you has sufficient income to provide
                for the children on their own. In families where one or both
                parents have children from previous relationships, parts of the
                family may be assessed separately.
